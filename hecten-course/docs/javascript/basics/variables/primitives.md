# Primitives
There are 3 main primitives you will use all the time in JS:

- `string`: Allow to store string values.
- `number`: Allow to store number values. Notice JS does not make any distinction between `int` and `float`
- `boolean`: Allow to store a boolean values `true` or `false` 

```js {monaco-run}
const myString = "A String";
const myNumber = 5;
const myBoolean = true;

let yourVariable;

console.log(yourVariable, typeof yourVariable)
```

Exercise: Try to change `yourVariable`'s value and see how it affects it's type;
