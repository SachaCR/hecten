# Commenting your code 
Comments are text that are not interpreted when the code is executed. They are used to explain or document what your code does. During this course they will be used to teach you Javascript concepts.

I also recommend that you comment your own code here are how you can add comments to your code.

There are 2 ways to write comments in your code: 
- A line starting with `//` allow to comment one line
- You can also create multi lines comments by using `/*` to start commenting and close the comment by `*/`

See examples: 

```js {monaco-run}
// This is a one line comment

/* 
    This is a 
    multi line 
    comment
*/ 
```
