# Getting Started

During these courses you will learn the very basics of Javascript syntax.
But first of all let's explain how you should use it.

## Code Blocks
During the different courses you will see code blocks.
Here is a code block: 

```javascript
// Try edit me
const message = 'Hello world!' 

// Log to console
console.log(message)
```

Most of the time you will have to copy and paste the code to execute it and complete the exercises. 

:::info Info
You can use [playcode.io](https://playcode.io/1964890) to run Javascript code without installing anything. Or see [Run code with NodeJS](/docs/nodejs/intro)
:::

:::tip Tip
You can copy and paste the code with the button on the code block's top right corner.
